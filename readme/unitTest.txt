== Unit testing ==

To test changes to the plugin you can use unit testing. Start by making sure all the necessary dependencies are installed, if not run:
<pre><code>
composer install
</code></pre>

You will need a new Wordpress installation to make sure the tests run
independent from your Wordpress installation and database. To create a wordpress installation for testing run the following command:
<pre><code>
bash bin/test_wp_install.sh wordpress_test db_username db_password localhost latest
</code></pre>

Where 'wordpress_test' is the name for the database used to run the tests. Make sure this database doesn't exist or can be deleted. When the database
already exists the script will ask you if the database can be deleted. 'Latest' can be changed if you want to test with a specific version of Wordpress, 3.6.2 for example.

After you installed you can start running tests using the follow command:
<pre><code>
vendor/bin/behat
</code></pre>

This will run all test. These tests include an import and export of all types of fields, cleaning, multiple fields in one field-group and tests for
the menu options. If you want to run one specific test you can do this by running:
<pre><code>
vendor/bin/behat features/testname.feature
</code></pre>

If you need a different test you can create your own by added it to the features in the features folder.
