=== WP-CLI for Advanced Custom Fields ===

== Description ==

WP-CLI for Advanced Custom Fields helps you manage your field-groups through WP-CLI.
The reason we started this project is to make life easier for developers working on Wordpress projects using the Advanced Custom Fields Pro plugin.
Fields can now easily be imported, exported and shared over SVN, GIT or comparable systems.
