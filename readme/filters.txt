= acfwpcli_fieldgroup_paths =

The acfwpcli_fieldgroup_paths gives you the ability to add more paths where ACF-CLI should load/export from/to.
You should always add at least one path to this filter.

**Example:**

```
add_filter( 'acfwpcli_fieldgroup_paths', 'add_plugin_path' );

public function add_plugin_path( $paths ) {
  $paths['my_plugin'] = MY_PLUGIN_ROOT . '/lib/field-groups/';
  return $paths;
}
